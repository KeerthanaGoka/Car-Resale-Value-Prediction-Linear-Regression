With this project, we aim to show how linear regression may be used practically in the automobile sector, by estimating the worth of cars during resale, leading to more informed decisions. 

By examining variables like brand, engine power, mileage, and year of production, a statistical technique called linear regression is useful for estimating automobile pricing.

 This approach finds correlations between these attributes and automobile pricing by looking at past sales data. Both buyers and sellers may make more informed selections with the help of this prediction model. 

Cars offered can be valued by buyers, and sellers can establish competition.
